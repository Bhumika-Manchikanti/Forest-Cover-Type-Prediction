# Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction
The global problem of monitoring the situation of trees in nature, the role of trees in human life and the planet, their impact on nature; the main problems caused by deforestation can be monitored.Predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover) from cartographic variables i.e., position, size, shape, value, color, orientation, and texture..  The data is in raw form and contains binary columns of data for qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas includes elevation, slope, distance from road, hill shade etcâ€¦ and soil type. Based on the variables we are going to predict the forest cover types i.e., the seven types of forest covers are Spruce/Fir, Lodgepole Pine, Ponderosa Pine, Cottonwood/Willow, Aspen, Douglas-fir, Krummholz
The goal of theProjectis to predict seven different cover types in four different wilderness areas i.e.,Rawah, Neota,Comanche Peak, Cache la Poudre. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.
